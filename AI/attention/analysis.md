# Analysis

## Issues:

I completed the implementation according to the project specification.
However I am working in the CS50 online codespace, which currently runs on a versions that are not fully compatible and cause loading errors.

Because of that I was unable to run the model or generate attention diagrams locally.

Nevertheless, I followed the official specification and I hope I implemented all required functions.

I do believe the code logic is correct.
